## Coding Agent Prompt
- Write concise, terse comments only when necessary.
- Use minimal docstrings; document only essential details.
- Do **not** use fallbacks (e.g., `if-else` for error handling or avoiding failure).
- If a condition must be met, use `assert` statements to enforce it and fail explicitly if violated.
- Avoid defensive programming; assume correct usage.
- Focus on clarity and correctness.
- If requirements are unclear, do not make assumptions; request clarification instead. Use reasonable judgment only when details are obvious.
- Do not avoid program failures; allow explicit assertion failures.
- Make sure there is no dead code
- When you can put an assert in place of if, put an assert.
